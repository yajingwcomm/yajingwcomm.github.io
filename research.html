### Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of computational social science, media psychology, and political communication. I am particularly interested in how digital platforms influence behavior, public opinion, and privacy norms. My current projects focus on AI-mediated communication, digital surveillance, and behavioral interventions in climate and health domains.
