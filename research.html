<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>
  I am fascinated by the intersection of emerging media technologies and socio-emotional functioning, approaching these topics through computational, experimental, survey-based, qualitative, and design-driven methods.
  My current research primarily focuses on <strong>human–AI interaction (HAII)</strong>, with particular interest in its social and affective dimensions. I am especially intrigued to explore the human factors and psychological mechanisms that underlie HAII dynamics.
  Ultimately, my goal is to contribute to the development of <strong>evidence-based design interventions</strong> that better support effective, meaningful, and ethical human–AI partnerships.
</p>
<p>My research interests include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) & Human-Centered AI</li>
  <li>AI-Mediated Communication (AI-MC)</li>
  <li>Social & Affective Computing</li>
  <li>Interaction & Experience Design / Research through Design (RtD)</li>
  <li>Computational Social Science Methods</li>
</ul>
